- BPMN graph impl -> add process properties support

- Morphing 
    - Annot Processing
        - annotations 
            - Add Morphing annotations
            - Move CanXXX (rules) & Definition annotations to base class? -> refactor adapters...
        - processors 
            - generate morphing adapters from morphing annotations
            - check morph properties must be read only and final?
    - Support
        - End events
        - Task -> types & subprocess
        - Gateways
    - Issues
        - keep graph element's UUID?
        - BPMN unit test class 
            - mock morphAdapters or provide some runtime test scope for it.... as TaskMorphAdapter will be generated
            - OryxMappingsManager -> do not hardcode inheritance morph types....
        - Toolbox
            - toolbox morph command -> only show if exist morph targets
            - one button for each target morph base
        - Check rules on MorphNodeCommand?

- Docking
    - issues
        - undock
            - from Dock to viewConnector
            - See undock.txt
    - shape views
        - timer icon position
        - when build first time into canvas -> children zindex different that when updating it
        
- Issues
    - Properties -> Support editable/non editable ( model?, forms, etc )
    - Improve selection of shapes
        - In general
        - Timer event -> cannot select when docked to a task?
    - Model
        - Creates Roles class with string memebers ( as current Categories )
        - genereate errai.properties with bindable/portable entities
        - Remove annotations from model
    - Undo
        - first command cannot be undone
    - ShapeProxies 
         - Children -> remove getNameProperty, getGlyphBgColor & getGlyphDescr
    - Missing decorators for static icons
    - docking fires with toolbox
    - View child position issues
        - Timer icon & bpmn interm event - not well centered
        - polygon with icon glyph -> icon at center
        - Shapes with static icons -> just adding on canvas, icon not at center
        - improves all shapes title (text) positions
    - Toolbox
        - Do as genmymodel -> show icons for target base elements -> and then the morhping minipalette
        - http://huxhzq.axshare.com/#g=1&p=process
    - Icons 
        - Mix dynamic & static into same class/proxy?
        - allow resize all?
        - provide icons from svg file or mutipaths serialized in some custom format?
    - Layer#onclick -> show diagram properties 
    
        
- Others
    - ToolboxProvider that automatically checks rules & determines which 
        commands (icons) can be present on the toolbox for those element
    - Remove Diagram shape usage from canvas
    - Review cdi beans contexts
        - to improve head performance
        - MorphAdapters & BindableAdapterFactory -> appScoped
