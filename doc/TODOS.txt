- Immediately
*************
    - Tree explorer - add treeitems on all sublevels
    - Commands - undo
    - custom graph factory for bpmn -> create a diagram by default
    - Delete from canvas - ( all children... )
        - Confirm delete alert
    - lanes support

      
- Next
*******

    - Save services & BPMN marshalling
    - improve server-client tx errai marshalling for definitions, graphs, diagrams


- Lienzo
********

    - Fix wires issues
        - WiresLayoutContainer - set positions when resizing
        - WiresManager - addToIndex not working for unconnected connectors
        - WiresShapeDragHandler -> fixes on highlight / unhighlight
        - Examples
            - Resize -> http://screencast.com/t/TjRkYpMvt
            - Align -> http://screencast.com/t/62lCjZGYDq7i
            
    - Wires refactors
        - Exctract logics for conttainment & connection ( hightlight parents, show magnets, etc) from drag event handlers
        
    - Others
        - Text orientation

- Dynamic forms
***************

    - Issues with property change event handlers
    - Create a doc with requirements ( field types, etc )
 
- Widgets
*********

    - Raw view of the graph
      - Draw all kind of content for nodes/edges as
        - node /vertex - circle
        - edge / relation - line
      - use a Canvas impl not using wires - LienzoCanvas
      - add info popup on over a vertex/edge
      - show as a pop on canvas screen
      
      
- House keeping & others
************************

    - BPMN marshalling / unmarshalling
        - Remove code from "legacy" package and use the jbpm-designer-backend artifact as a required dependency.
            - Exclude drools datamodeller transitive artifact -> It produces an errai compilation error
            - Try to exclude as much as possible the transitive dependencies
            - Currently some CDI issues appears when adding it...
     - Connections
        - Do not call head/tailConnectionAccepted until drag eng!
    - Generics cleaning
    - UX
        - Loading popups
        - Initially only show wizard screen - when creating/loading a diagram, show all other screens ( palette, props, etc )
    - Model
        - compile time generation adapters for Def, DefSet, PropSet
        - use of graph factories in client side 
        - Clone definitions and properties when creating graph elements -> errai low level serialization?- Cloning models
