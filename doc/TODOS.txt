    - Undo command if user action not allowed - redo canvas state
        - drag control + failed command -> use dragContxt.reset()?
    - BPMN Marshalling -> saved bound x/y coordinates and size (is negative) on bpmn file are not the right ones
    - Dynamic forms integration
    - Factories - child/view/parent edges ( use factories in commands, etc - avoid new operators )
    
    - managers & services
      - simplify + share impls
        - managers on api as services
        - managers on client client as caller/sender of the service itself
      - definition manager -> remove adapters from api and use them internally
        - sync/async command managers
        - performance
          - annot processors + client graph factories -> all ops on client side

    - Fix wires issues
        - WiresLayoutContainer - set positions when resizing
        - WiresManager - addToIndex not working for unconnected connectors
        - WiresShapeDragHandler -> fixes on highlight / un-highlight
        - Examples
            - Resize -> http://screencast.com/t/TjRkYpMvt
            - Align -> http://screencast.com/t/62lCjZGYDq7i

    - Shape order ( flows, parent/child nodes, etc )
    - review wires containment. Eg: lanes -> if dragging lane title inside the lane, the lane gets removed from the parent diagram and then it sometimes gets on top and nothing can be moved inside it.

    - Wires refactors
        - Exctract logics for containment & connection ( highlight parents, show magnets, etc) from drag event handlers
        
    - Others
        - Text orientation

- Dynamic forms
***************

    - Issues with property change event handlers
    - Create a doc with requirements ( field types, etc )
    - custom property types
    - composite props - depends on the other properties' values
    - avoid custom forks!?!?

        - Notifications
            - custom level for "loading..." popups
            - exceptions on client code - use notif cdi events & gwt logging
            
        - Raw view of the graph
          - Draw all kind of content for nodes/edges as
            - node /vertex - circle
            - edge / relation - line
          - use a Canvas impl not using wires - LienzoCanvas
          - add info popup on over a vertex/edge
          - show as a pop on canvas screen
      
- API
*****

    - Commands
        - ensure only single parent/edge connections between nodes
         - CommManager
            - executions async - use callbacks as expensive ops can be executed on backend asynchronously
            - Provide different implementations:
                - basic
                - stacked (with history & undo )
                - stacked + batch
                      - for canvas handler internal executions on batch ( startBatch, execute xN, endBatch)
                      - on each batch you can spcify block screen ( modal loading ) or not
                      - canvas listeners fired once per element
        - Undo's
        - Restore the graph to a previous state
   
   - Model
          - compile time generation adapters for Def, DefSet, PropSet
          - use of graph factories in client side 
          - Clone definitions and properties when creating graph elements -> errai low level serialization?- Cloning models
Backend
*******
    - create snapshot copies of d diagram
    - Missing diagram services ( such as delete )
    - improve server-client tx errai marshalling for definitions, graphs, diagrams
    - Consider performance on marshalling/unmarshalling  & builders/parsers 
        - current impl does not consider big files, as it just creates all the objects in memory once when initialized.
        -> incremental approach
    - BPMN marshalling
        - The resulting bpmn file contains negative size for bpmn elements
        - Resulting positions in bpmn file are not correct

  - typesafe velocity templates? 
  - TemplateResult 
    - add skipped results ( pojos + message )
  - generated files indentation
  
- House keeping & others
************************

    - Factories/CDI Producers
        - use a producer for the different traverse, index, managers etc?
        - ModelFactory has producer methods, so the model can be injected ( if no producer, use the modelfactory iface methods )
        - DefManager.getDefSet - call producer method to obtain a singleton instance
        - use producers for commands, so beans can be injected

    - BPMN marshalling / unmarshalling
        - Remove code from "legacy" package and use the jbpm-designer-backend artifact as a required dependency.
            - Exclude drools datamodeller transitive artifact -> It produces an errai compilation error
            - Try to exclude as much as possible the transitive dependencies
            - Currently some CDI issues appears when adding it...
     - Connections
        - Do not call head/tailConnectionAccepted until drag eng!
    - Generics cleaning
    - UX
        - Loading popups
        - Initially only show wizard screen - when creating/loading a diagram, show all other screens ( palette, props, etc )
   - I18n
