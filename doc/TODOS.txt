    - Sequence flows stuff
        - Let unconnected
        - Drop from palette
        - command undo's
        
    - Lienzo stuff
            
    - build glyphs from its shapes? not force building two impls

    - Known issues
        
        - Canvas loading related issues
            - loading box -> does not appear when loading a diagram or adding a shape from palette ( it should appear )
            - load & draw diagram - too much loading time ( but not so much in production mode... )
    
        - Navigator 
            - clean when no session or session closed
            - Reduce size for preview
            - Context2D proxy ( Mark ) 
        
        - Toolbox
            - Moving parent diagram -> toolboxes bad coordinates
            - Remove toolbox icons when shape deleted from canvas
            
        - Palette
            - add connection toolbox command -> click on diagram as target node -> exception thrown 
            - bounds indexer - graph vs canvas & fixings ( builders & drag proxies )
            - onclick -> add node in same parent, no need to drag...
            
- Lienzo
********

    - Fix wires issues
        - WiresLayoutContainer - set positions when resizing
        - WiresManager - addToIndex not working for unconnected connectors
        - WiresShapeDragHandler -> fixes on highlight / un-highlight
        - Examples
            - Resize -> http://screencast.com/t/TjRkYpMvt
            - Align -> http://screencast.com/t/62lCjZGYDq7i
        - Events
            - More events and provide the natives...
            - Drag event -> cannot get the DragContext
            - In general -> return the handler registration as well in order to remove handlers when no necessary.

    - External configs
        - Connectors / docking hotspot size
    - When dragging parent shapes, the connectors on the children are not drag
    - containment & docking acceptor -> shapes fill issues
    - Align&Distribute broken ->  check browser console at https://www.lienzo-core.com/lienzo-ks/#ALIGN_DISTRIBUTE 
    - DockingAndContainmentHandler - priorFill/alpha issues
    - Shape order ( flows, parent/child nodes, etc )
    - review wires containment. 
        - Eg: lanes -> if dragging lane title inside the lane, the lane gets removed from the parent diagram and then it sometimes gets on top and nothing can be moved inside it.
        - dragging children shapes crashed with docking... ( toolbox )
        
    - Wires refactors
        - Exctract logics for containment & connection ( highlight parents, show magnets, etc) from drag event handlers
        
    - Others
        - Text orientation

- Client
*********

    - General
        - Help widgets & tooltips/popovers
        - Error handling
        - refactor use of CDI qualifiers ( managers & services ) -> CDI @Priority 
        - Show/Hide grid toolbar button
    
    - Shape Factories
            - ShapeFactories from Shape Set ( annotated on @ShapeSet )
            - ShapeManager#getFactory -> use shapeSetId as argument
            
    - Usability
        - dragging constrained just for diagram bounds?

    - Controls
        - Toolbox
            - Icon titles/tooltips
        - SelectionControl
            - Select multiple

    - Load diagram screen
        - Pagination

    - Notifcations widget
        - Design
        - Pagination
        - Row colors ( different notification types )
        
    - Canvas Toolbar    
        - Toolbar undo & clearSelection should be initially disabled

    - Toolbox 
        - bounding box for whole shape bounds as well
        - Disable/enable commands
        - Titles / tooltips

- API
*****

    - model
        - Definition Impls -> finish implementation & generate from ifaces and the adapter as well
        - Performance
            - private constructors
            - review inmutability (final fields) -> bindable needs pub no-arg const! How 2 deal with finals?
            - if making fields static -> marhsalls as null... ( eg: DefSet#labels )
            - builders
                - mark as @NonPortable
                - auto generate when using annotated models?
        - avoid @Portable and @Bindable and generate the Errai.properties for the annotated pojos.
        
    - Graph Processors - declare as @Remote ifaces

    - Commands
        - UNDO's
            - ClearGraph
        - Fix -> both SetConnectionSourceNodeCommand/Target commands are checking rules using same arguments...
        - ensure only single parent/edge connections between nodes
         - CommManager
            - executions async ( use of Caller's ) - use callbacks as expensive ops can be executed on backend asynchronously
        - Restore the graph to a previous state
        - REDO's

    - Look-ups
        - Add cache
        - Use Caller's on client side
        - Use Dashbuilder's DataSets?
        
Annotation processors
*********************

    - Check that each annotation is present on expected domain model class

Backend
*******

    - Missing diagram services ( such as delete )
        - diagrams sync / commands sync between client & tenant managers on server side

Import tool
************

  - refactor to current API
  - typesafe velocity templates? 
  - TemplateResult 
    - add skipped results ( pojos + message )
  - generated files indentation

Performance
***********

    - Global
        - Heap, cpu & timeline performance checks
        
    - Controls 
        - Check disable() 
        - Check de-registrations ( handlers, etc )
    
    - Session widgets
        - Checks session events are handled as expected
        
    - TreeExplorer 
        - redraw only updated element & children, if any.

    - Load diagram
        - Slow - Heap & cpu performance check

    - Custom Map impl for storing DefSet stuff ( valid to use on bindable adapters, indexes, etc )
    
    - Client
        - CanvasHandler & handleZIndex
            - Really need of ShapeView#ZIndex? or exist a problem on traverse processor while drawing ( bad order )?
        
House keeping & others
**********************
    
    - recompiling canvas controls forces to restart server always? ( csadilek )
    - Unit testing
    - Distros
        - remove beans.xml exclusion for org.wirez.client... should not be there. 
    - Remove GraphBoundsIndexBuilder and use Layer#findShapeAt ( check Builder control & GraphBoundsIndexer & LienzoLayerUtils )
    - BPMN marshalling / unmarshalling
        - Remove code from "legacy" package and use the jbpm-designer-backend artifact as a required dependency.
            - Exclude drools datamodeller transitive artifact -> It produces an errai compilation error
            - Try to exclude as much as possible the transitive dependencies
            - Currently some CDI issues appears when adding it...
     - Connections
        - Do not call head/tailConnectionAccepted until drag eng!
    - i18n
